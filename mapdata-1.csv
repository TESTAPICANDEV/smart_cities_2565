The proposed platform would seek to significantly broaden the palette of mobility options available to residents of lower-density communities, including coastal communities, so citizens of all ages and abilities can get where they need to go, when they need to do so, without needing to get behind the wheel of a private vehicle. Residents of small communities across the nation are looking for efficient, affordable, and low-impact mobility and transportation options, and this proposed project would ultimately provide it to them.  Along the way it seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve quality of life and public health, and strengthen connections and resilience. The proposed project would not only seek to strengthen local economies in small communities that often depend on tourism or natural-resource revenue, it would drive Canadian clean growth and innovation.

In response, Langford’s Smart City Strategy and pilot project proposal aims to leverage these circumstances into unprecedented affordability and livability through data and interconnected technology. Comprised of a unified Internet of Things (IoT) platform strategy, this cloud-based technology extracts, computes and moves data from connected things to IoT applications to deliver transparent and meaningful information and services with regard to consumption and efficiency. Opportunities within these data are translated into cost savings and discounts on monthly billing and rent cycles, reduced GHG emissions, and an overall reduction of waste and maintenance costs – keeping Langford affordable, livable and sustainable in the context of provincial strategies and existing municipal priorities",Economic opportunity|Environmental quality,Economic development|Environment|Land use planning and development|Roads and transportation|Social services|Waste|Water and wastewater,Cloud computing|Environmental monitoring|Geospatial|Internet of Things (IoT)|Mobile applications|Open data platforms|Payment platforms|Sensors,http://www.langford.ca/

By weaving together local First Nation, pioneer and natural histories and combining the result with emergency planning and work training initiatives, a concept has evolved that will create a mesmerizing, spellbinder of a destination while addressing a second serious local issue, emergency preparedness. As a showcase for new and innovative social media apps and virtual and augmented reality exhibits we will activate your blinker and direct you to the exit.

District of Squamish,No,British Columbia,19512,$ 10 million,"Squamish, one of Canada’s fastest-growing municipalities, will engage and empower our community to sustainably grow by reducing overall waste, and by turning waste into assets — clean energy, renewable materials and new products — at once powering our economy, creating future-focused jobs, and exceeding government waste and greenhouse gas emission targets.","As a fast-growing community, the District of Squamish faces the challenge of how to accommodate a rising population while still achieving our ambitious environmental and sustainability targets. By 2036, the population is projected to nearly double from 20,000 to 36,000. This rapid growth will increase waste, and, based on current employment data, require a significant and growing number of community members to commute to jobs outside of Squamish, increasing both their cost of living and their greenhouse gas emissions. As current District programs like recycling and energy reduction will not be sufficient to meet our community’s ambitious Zero-waste action plan, Squamish has chosen to pursue a path of sustainable growth using the principles of the circular economy. Working with our partners — UBC CERC, BCIT SMART, Powertech Labs, Philips Canada, Ecube Labs, Squamish & District Forestry Association, Carbon Engineering and Stuart Olson — and in collaboration with Squamish Nation and our local community, Squamish will transform our environmental footprint by using innovation, data and connected technology to eliminate waste leakage, extend the lifecycles of what we make, and use and convert waste, in particular, biomass, into renewable, clean energy, creating a living laboratory for communities across Canada and the world to benefit from.",Economic opportunity|Environmental quality,Economic development|Education and training|Environment|Land use planning and development|Recreation and parks|Roads and transportation|Waste|Water and wastewater,Big data analytics|Cloud computing|Enterprise solutions|Environmental monitoring|Geospatial|Internet of Things (IoT)|Mobile applications|Networks|Open data platforms|Payment platforms|Sensors,http://www.squamish.ca/smart-cities-challenge

As a result of climate change and sea level rise, storm-induced inundation events also contribute to the hazards that threaten this coast. The Wave Safe initiative will achieve multiple objectives to protect BC’s coast by providing real-time and forecasted wave and sea state conditions and by implementing an automatic alert for earthquakes, tsunamis and storm-induced inundation events. These measures will better protect lives and livelihoods by helping inform first responders, community planners and educators of an impending incident. Wave Safe will also enhance the west coast tourism industry by providing an ocean forecasting smart phone applications for citizens and visitors, and provide new opportunities for STEM education through exposing children in communities and First Nations schools to big data, computing, and Artificial Intelligence solutions.

These buildings are home to a significant number of low-income families and their 47,000 children. These children are an important part of Toronto's future.These communities are physically isolated from many jobs and opportunities. They are often devoid of services such as child-care, health care or programs linking residents with opportunities and the city at large. As a result, residents experience barriers to employment, education and training, social and cultural opportunities.Even more concerning is that many residents in these communities are digitally isolated. This is due to a lack of affordable high-speed Internet access and low levels of digital knowledge and skills required to take full advantage of the rapidly changing digitally-focused economy.Our proposal is to provide all of these families: access to high-speed Internet, the means to improve digital literacy and a smart, community-focused, digital platform. This platform will make connections between residents and economic opportunities, allow us to understand the needs of the people in these communities, and measure outcomes and success.Ultimately, we will significantly reduce child poverty within these high-rise communities.

People are being left behind, many of them are youth, and many of them are urban Indigenous youth. Urban Indigenous youth face multiple challenges that are rooted in intergenerational trauma, racism, and a disrupted relationship with cultural and spiritual traditions. This is manifesting itself in an escalating cycle of crime that results in Saskatoon having a youth incarceration rate that is double the national average.This cycle of crime and social exclusion is resulting in millions of dollars being spent to warehouse people in facilities where instead of rehabilitating they become hardened and in many cases involved in increasingly serious crime. This cycle continues through generations. The existing system is failing all of us.The City of Saskatoon has initiated a partnership with key institutions all committed to working together in finding proactive, preventative solutions to youth incarceration. Our Smart Cities Challenge will build on this collaborative work and use innovative technology to strengthen and connect the supports for youth to grow in a positive learning cycle rather than find themselves pulled into a cycle of crime.",Empowerment and inclusion|Safety and security,Arts and culture|Education and training|Emergency services and enforcement|Public health|Recreation and parks|Social services,Artificial intelligence (AI)|Big data analytics|Cloud computing|Internet of Things (IoT)|Mobile applications|Open data platforms|Other: Please specify,https://www.saskatoon.ca/engage
